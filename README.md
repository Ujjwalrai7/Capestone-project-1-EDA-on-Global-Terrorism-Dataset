In the context of global terrorism, EDA can provide valuable insights into the nature and patterns of terrorist attacks worldwide, helping us understand the evolving threat of terrorism and informing policy decisions aimed at preventing and mitigating its impact. Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is one of the most comprehensive and widely used datasets on terrorism. It contains information on terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2017, including the date, location, type, and severity of the attack, as well as information on the perpetrators and victims involved. The dataset also contains information on the weapons and tactics used in the attack, the targets of the attack, and the group or ideology behind the attack.Given the vast amount of data contained in the GTD, EDA is an essential step in understanding the data and extracting meaningful insights. By visualizing the data, exploring patterns and trends, and identifying relationships between variables, we can gain a better understanding of the nature and patterns of global terrorism. In summary, EDA on the GTD is a critical step in analyzing and understanding the data, providing valuable insights into the evolving threat of terrorism and informing policy decisions aimed at preventing and mitigating its impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Problem Statement                                                                                                                                                        The problem statement for conducting EDA on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) can be framed as follows                                                               Specifically, the analysis aims to answer questions such as:                                                                                                                     
What are the overall trends in terrorist activity over time?                                                                                                            
Which regions of the world are most affected by terrorist attacks, and what are the characteristics of these attacks?
What types of weapons and tactics are commonly used in terrorist attacks, and how have these changed over time?
What are the demographic characteristics of the perpetrators of terrorist attacks?
Can we identify patterns in the data that may be useful for predicting and preventing future terrorist attacks?The goal of this analysis is to provide policymakers, security agencies, and the general public with a better understanding of the nature and patterns of global terrorism, as well as insights that can inform policy decisions aimed at preventing and mitigating the impact of terrorist attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Introduction to Dataset                                                                                                                                                  The global terrorism dataset contains 181000 rows and 135 labels the major columns contains the information such as eventid, year, month, day, country, city province/state, region, of attacks held all over the world. It also contains columns such as killed and wounded personalities in a particular attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Data Manipulations                                                                                                                                                      I have just replaced the null values of the killed and the wounded columns with 0 and also introduced a new column called casualties which is the sum of killed and the wounded people of any attack. Also I have tried to extract some of the insights such as which year had the most no of attacks which country has faced the most no of attacks which region and the city is the hotspot for terrorsist attacks etc. Let's try to undertand the insights of the analysis through graphs and visualisation.                                                                                                                                                                              Data Visualisation                                                                                                                                                      I have used matplotlib, seaborn & plotly libraries to draw the various charts such as line chart, pie chart, bar graph, Histogram, correlation Heatmap & Pair plot etc.  ![newplot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125723652/219847937-33174a99-7630-4d61-8183-801ab419b32e.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The above chart represents the trends of no. of. attacks by any terrorist groups all over the globe.                                                                    the insights that can be generated from the above chart is that** Taliban** is responsible for most of the attacks across the globe which is followed by ISIL & SL groups respectively.
